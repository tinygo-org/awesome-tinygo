# Awesome TinyGo

## Continuous Integration

* [TinyHCI](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyhci) - Test actual hardware connections for microcontrollers. It is intended to provide smoke test implementations that exercise the basic functionality for each kind of hardware interface for each supported microcontroller.
## Display Hardware
* [TinyDraw](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinydraw) - Draw primitives on TinyGo displays. It is heavily based on the Adafruit GFX library.
* [TinyFont](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyfont) - Font/text package for TinyGo displays. It is heavily based on Adafruit's GFX library.
* [TinyTerm](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyterm) - A minimal terminal for TinyGo devices supporting 256-color ANSI escape codes.
* [SSD1306 font](https://github.com/Nondzu/ssd1306_font) - Lite SSD1306 OLED font library using TinyGo.



## Embedded Systems

### General use
* [go-pico](https://github.com/djthorpe/go-pico) - Raspberry Pi RP2040 Pico SDK for golang.
* [mm-go](https://github.com/joetifa2003/mm-go) - Generic manual memory management for golang
* [tinyfs](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinyfs) - Embedded filesystems for TinyGo like FATfs and LittleFS on microcontrollers.
* [TinyGo Drivers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers) - Provides a collection of hardware drivers for devices such as sensors and displays that can be used together with TinyGo.
* [bouncer](https://github.com/eyelight/bouncer) - bouncer is a button input handler library supporting press-lengths of different durations, and debouncing.

### Protocol implementations
* [achicken](https://github.com/soypat/achicken) - Dead-simple serial protocol with CRC for small projects.
* [ether-swtch](https://github.com/soypat/ether-swtch) - Low level Ethernet/IP/TCP/HTTP stack marshaller/unmarshaller for use in tiny places.
* [go-canard](https://github.com/soypat/go-canard) - CAN/OpenCyphal implementation in pure Go. Port of libcanard.
* [natiu-mqtt](https://github.com/soypat/natiu-mqtt) - A dead-simple, extensible MQTT implementation well suited for embedded systems.
* [peamodbus](https://github.com/soypat/peamodbus) - Fault tolerant, TCP modbus implementation in Go that just works. Apt for embedded systems.
* [peasocket](https://github.com/soypat/peasocket) - Dead-simple, extensible websocket implementation in Go.
* [tiny-sproto](https://github.com/soypat/tiny-sproto) - A simple Point-to-Point Protocol implementation written in Go.

### Instrumentation and control with sensors and actuators
* [fusion](https://github.com/aykevl/fusion) - Sensor fusion algorithms (gyroscope/accelerometer) implemented in pure Go.
* [magcal](https://github.com/ysoldak/magcal) - (Magical) Magnetometer Calibration
* [pctl](https://github.com/brandondube/pctl) - "process control" is a package for industrial control in Go. Filtering and control theory algorithms.


## WebAssembly
### DOM Manipulation

* [TinyDom](https://github.com/Nerzal/tinydom) - DOM manipulation library. For use in WASM

### WebSockets

* [TinyWebSocket](https://github.com/Nerzal/tinywebsocket) - Wraps the `syscall/js` api to provide a better developer experience, while being compileable by TinyGo
## Wireless Communication

* [Go Bluetooth](https://github.com/tinygo-org/bluetooth) - Go Bluetooth is a cross-platform package for using Bluetooth Low Energy hardware from the Go programming language.
